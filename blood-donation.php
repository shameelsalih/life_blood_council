              37000 persons are required to donate blood every day in our country to meet the requirement of blood and its components for patients with various medical conditions. Blood centres spread across the country have the responsibility of ensuring blood sufficiency. A large portion of blood comes into blood centres through blood donation camps. It is important to identify segments (colleges, offices, religious institutions, community centres, residential areas, public places) where camps can be organised. These camps should be scheduled in such a manner that there is a steady flow of blood into blood centres throughout the year.

            <p>
              In cases where there is a large need for platelets, platelets obtained after component separation from blood collected during routine blood donation do not suffice. It is important to have donors who donate platelets through a process called apheresis. The apheresis procedure takes approximately 1 hour, and the platelets so obtained are called single donor platelets (SDP). Platelets have a shelf life of only 5 days, and therefore most SDP donors are required to donate blood according to specific requirements. There is a need to create awareness and build a registry of platelet donors who will respond to calls against specific requirements. Platelets are normally required by cancer patients, stem cell transplant patients, organ transplant patients, aplastic anaemia patients, and patients with malaria, dengue fever, and clotting disorders.

            <p>
              Granulocytes (a type of White Blood Cell) make up only a small percentage of human blood.They can also be obtained from blood through apheresis, as in the case of platelets. However, because human blood is smaller in quantity, the process takes much longer (close to 4 hours). Apart from the lengthy process, the donors are required to take injections which will mobilise granulocytes from the bone marrow into the blood stream. This injection is required to be taken approximately 10 hours before the apheresis procedure. It is necessary to raise awareness and establish a registry of granulocyte donors who will respond to specific requests.Granulocytes are required by some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and by some stem cell transplant patients.

              "Bombay" blood group is extremely rare. Transfusion-dependent patients with this blood group may find it extremely difficult to find blood or donors. A registry of people with this rare blood group is required
