  [
    "title"   =>  "At what age should I do the test?",
    "content" =>  "You can do the test at any age. Ideally before you get married you should know whether you are a Thalassemia Minor. But definitely before having a child."

  [
    "title"   =>  "What does the test involve?",
    "content" =>  "The test involves drawing 2 ml. of blood by using a sterilized, disposable syringe. This will take less than half a minute, after which you are free to leave. The result will be shared shortly."
