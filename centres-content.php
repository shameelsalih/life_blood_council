                    The concept of Day Care Centres is relevant for all medical conditions, and should be increasingly used wherever possible, as it reduces the strain on scarce medical beds and manpower, apart from saving time (and therefore money) for the patient and accompanying persons. Day Care Centres are particularly relevant in the case of Thalassemia, where the management of the disorder is life-long, with routine transfusion of red blood cells, regular daily medicines, and periodic laboratory investigations. Most families of persons with TDT are not able to cope with the disorder, and find it difficult to comply with the advice of the doctors due to financial, social and psychological reasons. It is necessary that patients are hand-held continuously for each aspect of the treatment. Day Care Centres are the best way to facilitate this hand-holding, leading to comprehensive management of the disorder, particularly for financially-disadvantaged families.

                  <p>
                    Except in the case of major cities, most persons with TDT have no access to proper Thalassemia Day Care Centres. Then, there are some facilities which are termed as Day Care Centres, which do not have blood centres/storage centres of their own. After reaching the so-called Day Care Centre and collecting the prescription letter for blood units along with blood samples, parents and patients hope that the required units are available in some blood centre. If they come empty-handed, they have to make another trip some other day. Secondly, visits to the such Transfusion facilities are made on the judgement of the parents, who go on the basis of pallor or drop in activity of their child. Many patients are found to have very low levels of pre-transfusion hemoglobin. Quite a few of them have enlarged spleens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a need to establish Thalassemia Day Care Centres which will primarily ensure "transfusion therapy" in line with the guidelines. Personnel attached to newly established Day Care Centres may get intimidated by the need for comprehensive management of TDT. They should be reassured that they would have largely discharged their duty by performing the first line of management of TDT-i.e. transfusion of Packed Cells. Having established a certain level of comfort, the new Centre can be trained and asked to shoulder the responsibility of other aspects of care of TDT. In the meantime, the Day Care Centre may direct the patients to a Referral Centre for comprehensive care. Organizations working for the cause of Thalassemia in the region/state may be contacted for assisting in the process of comprehensive care.
