                Alpha-thalassemia occurs when there is a problem with the production of the alpha globin chain of hemoglobin. There are four genes that control the production of alpha globin, if one or more of these genes are missing or not functioning properly, it can cause alpha-thalassemia.

                Beta-Thalassemia Major is a genetic blood disorder. It is also called "Cooley's Anemia" or or simply "Thalassemia". Beta-Thalassemia Major is characterized by the inability of the body to produce appropriate hemoglobin, results in inadequate delivery of oxygen to the different cells of the body. The disorder, in most cases, is diagnosed in the first year of the life of the child.

                Symptoms of thalassemia can vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. Common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, paleness, slow growth, and bone deformities.<br/><br/>
                Thalassemia is diagnosed by a combination of blood tests, including complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin electrophoresis, and genetic testing.

            <p>
              Blood transfusions are medical procedures in which blood or blood components are transferred from one person (donor) into the bloodstream of another person (recipient).<br/><br/>
              The goal of blood transfusions is to replace lost blood, correct anemia, or treat certain medical conditions by providing essential components such as red blood cells, platelets, or plasma. The blood must be compatible with the recipient's blood type to avoid adverse reactions.

            <p>
              Chelation therapy is a medical treatment in which a synthetic solution (chelating agent) is administered to a patient intravenously to remove heavy metals, minerals, and other toxic substances from the body.<br/><br/>
              It is commonly used for individuals with high levels of lead or other heavy metals in the bloodstream and for individuals with metal toxicity due to occupational or environmental exposure.

              Bone Marrow Transplant can help cure the disease and prevent serious complications, such as anemia and organ damage.<br/><br/>
