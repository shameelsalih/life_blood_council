              <p>
                Blood transfusions are medical procedures in which blood or blood components are transferred from one person (donor) into the bloodstream of another person (recipient).<br /><br />
                The goal of blood transfusions is to replace lost blood, correct anemia, or treat certain medical conditions by providing essential components such as red blood cells, platelets, or plasma. The blood must be compatible with the recipient's blood type to avoid adverse reactions.

              <p>
                Chelation therapy is a medical treatment in which a synthetic solution (chelating agent) is administered to a patient intravenously to remove heavy metals, minerals, and other toxic substances from the body.<br /><br />
                It is commonly used for individuals with high levels of lead or other heavy metals in the bloodstream and for individuals with metal toxicity due to occupational or environmental exposure.

The third line in the management of the disorder is periodic laboratory and radiological investigations to detect complications at an early stage so that remedial action can be taken before they assume life-threatening proportions. â€” This section can be reformatted to appear in the Knowledge section</p></p>

                <p class="pt-sm-5">
                  The concept of Day Care Centers is relevant for all medical conditions, and should be increasingly used wherever possible, as it reduces the strain on scarce medical beds and manpower, apart from saving time (and therefore money) for the patient and accompanying persons. Day Care Centers are particularly relevant in the case of Thalassemia, where the management of the disorder is life-long, with routine transfusion of red blood cells, regular daily medicines, and periodic laboratory investigations. Most families of persons with TDT are not able to cope with the disorder, and find it difficult to comply with the advice of the doctors due to financial, social and psychological reasons. It is necessary that patients are hand-held continuously for each aspect of the treatment. Day Care Centers are the best way to facilitate this hand-holding, leading to comprehensive management of the disorder, particularly for financially-disadvantaged families.

                <p>
                  Except in the case of major cities, most persons with TDT have no access to proper Thalassemia Day Care Centers. Then, there are some facilities which are termed as Day Care Centers, which do not have blood centers/storage centers of their own. After reaching the so-called Day Care Centre and collecting the prescription letter for blood units along with blood samples, parents and patients hope that the required units are available in some blood centre. If they come empty-handed, they have to make another trip some other day. Secondly, visits to the such Transfusion facilities are made on the judgement of the parents, who go on the basis of pallor or drop in activity of their child. Many patients are found to have very low levels of pre-transfusion hemoglobin. Quite a few of them have enlarged spleens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a need to establish Thalassemia Day Care Centers which will primarily ensure "transfusion therapy" in line with the guidelines. Personnel attached to newly established Day Care Centers may get intimidated by the need for comprehensive management of TDT. They should be reassured that they would have largely discharged their duty by performing the first line of management of TDT-i.e. transfusion of Packed Cells. Having established a certain level of comfort, the new Centre can be trained and asked to shoulder the responsibility of other aspects of care of TDT. In the meantime, the Day Care Centre may direct the patients to a Referral Centre for comprehensive care. Organisations working for the cause of Thalassemia in the region/state may be contacted for assisting in the process of comprehensive care.

Thalassemia major is characterised by the inability of the body to produce appropriate haemoglobin, resulting in inadequate delivery of oxygen to the different cells of the body. The disorder, in most cases, is diagnosed in the first year of the life of the child."

    "title"   =>  "Who is responsible for a thalassemic child?",
    "content" =>  "A thalassemic child is born only if both parents have thalassemia minor (also called thalassemia trait or carrier of thalassemia). Most thalassemia minors are unaware of this status and go through life normally. But if both partners in a marriage are thalassemia minor, they run the risk (25%) of having a thalassemia major child in each pregnancy. Therefore, two healthy youngsters (the parents), who did not know that they had thalassemia minor, were responsible for a child with thalassemia major.
